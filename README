# Configuration üõ†Ô∏è
Firs of all you need to clone this repository and change the main folder name
`clena_architecture_boilerplate` -> `your_awesome_project`.

Then, you need to install all the dependencies, this project is managed by
`poetry`, and the other part, for development purpose is with pip.

To install the project dependencies, you need to:
```shell script
$ poetry install
```


And the development packages with pip:
```shell script
$ pip install -r conf/requirements.txt
```

This is to keep the development dependencies away from production and necesary
package for the right operation of the project.

So, if you need to install development dependencies is with `pip` and for project
with `poetry`.

```shell script
$ pre-commit install
```
